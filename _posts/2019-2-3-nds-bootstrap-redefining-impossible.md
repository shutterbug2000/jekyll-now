title: nds-bootstrap - redefining "impossible"
---

2 years ago, myself(shutterbug2000), RocketRobz(then called Robz8), ahezard, and Apache Thunder released the first build of nds-bootstrap capable of running retail games. At that time, people in the community still firmly believed that flashcarts were the way to go, and that it was impossible to load games from an SD card. When nds-bootstrap saw its first public release, it was slow, buggy, and you couldn't even save the game at all. Yet, today, nds-bootstrap runs (most) games at full speed, something that many people claimed would never happen. It saves the game without any wierd trickery. It runs everything except for a few edge case games. Now, "impossible" is reality.

To everyone who uses nds-bootstrap: You're the reason this has come as far as it has, and provide me (and everyone else) the motivation to keep on improving it.
Thank you.
